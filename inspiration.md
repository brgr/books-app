# Inspiration

## Project-Related Inspiration

Related to books.

### Online Libraries

To find more libraries: [Wikipedia Book Search / Sources][7] ([see below for more notes on this](#book-search))

- [OpenLibrary][9]

  Really fantastic. Is [on GitHub with an AGPL license][10] and in general with lots of books that can be fetched using
  its API.
  Furthermore, its GitHub wiki and its "About" pages have some good information:
  - [Infogami, its own developed database][11]
  - [Librarianship (a lot on their data model)][12] 
  - [Their Data Sources][13]
  - [Some general stuff for librarians, that is definitely also useful to me][14]
  - [**Their Book Metadata Schemas and Thoughts**][15]

### Book Search

- [Wikipedia Book Search / Sources][7]

  This is actually a great resource to find many **available** sources! See [this search][8] for how many results this
  actually delivers!

### Full Book Download

- [BookCut][1]: loads book in the CLI from libgen and/or OpenLibrary

## General Inspiration

Not directly related to anything with books.

### Open Projects in General

Open projects in general, that are nicely done.

- [lichess][2]: Play chess online. It's a really nice website used by many people all over the world. The author relies
  fully on donations. [Here][3] is a nice list of how many donations the author gets and how it is spent. [Here][4] is a
  blog article by the author of the software, on why Lichess will always be free and [here][5] is the HN discussion on
  that.

### Projects Where People Work Mostly Alone on Them

And make money.

- Lichess (see above)
- pinboard.in
- Cursive IDE

## UI

- Search Bar

  My initial inspiration came from [this][6] mockup.
